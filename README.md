# project_2_Red_VS_bleu_team
In the second project week, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.
